# React-Logbook

Rowing and sailing are popular sports in germany. Insurances require rowers/sailors to sign in to
a logbook, when hitting the water and sign out on return.

This is a web app version of the logbook for public use in the boat house. We have a protected admin
interface to manage users and boats within this app.
We will have a smart phone mobile app that is bound to a specific member and allows her to
create a new trip
sign in to existing trip
start a trip
end a trip
in a fast and simple way. We will make sure all apps instances are kept in sync
